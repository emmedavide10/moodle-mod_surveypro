What surveypro does

Surveypro is a moodle module to create custom surveys.
User can create custom surveys such as create standard surveys.
Standard surveys managed by surveypro are: ATTLS, COLLES and CI.

The main news of surveypro are:
• question branching
• required fields
• element level validation
• elements limited to teachers only

Surveypro has pluggable plugins for:
• field elements
• format elements
• preset templates
• reoprts

How a surveypro module page appears
• to students
• to teachers

A surveypro can be delivered in a lot of different ways for a lot of different purposes.
Because of this some settings were added to personalize each surveypro.
Settings are divided into: global site settings level and instance settings level.
You can get the first through Administration -> Plugins -> Activity modules -> Survey

This set of settings includes...
... for the surveypro module:
• Max input delay: the maximum time allowed to finalize a surveypro response once paused.
A surveypro can be paused so the user is alloed to stop its compilation and start it again in a second time.
• Extra note in search form: Sometimes the content of the element question is not enough to exactly describe
what an element is really asking. Because of this elements can be equipped with some extra detail.
Must these details be displayed in the search form too?
• Filling instruction in search form: some elements are equipped with a short "Instruction guide".
For instance: "An email is expected here" or "Only numbers lower than 50 are expected here".
Must these "Instruction guides" be displayed in the search form too?

... for "age" surveypro plugin:
• Maximum age: simply the maximum age allowed all over the site.
This value can be further restricted by a similar setting at element level.

... for "integer" surveypro plugin:
• Maximum integer: simply the maximum integer allowed all over the site.
This value can be further restricted by a similar setting at element level.

... for "ATTLS (20 item version)", "COLLES (Actual)" ,"COLLES (Preferred and Actual)" and "COLLES (Preferred)" surveypro plugin:
• Position of attls elements question: the place where the question of each element will be located.
The position usually depends from the size of the monitor of the foreseen class.
• Style of the choice elements: Standard surveys like ATTLS, COLLES and CI are mainly made by multichoice questions.
They can be realized using radiobuttons or drop down menu both.

In addition to global site settings level, affecting EACH surveypro, surveypro provides a set of instance level settings.
They are:
• Available from: the first date available for students to fill a survey..
• Available to: the last date available for students to fill a survey.
• Branches increase pagese: a branch in the survey is always followed by an automatic page break in the survey.
• Allow Pause/Resume: allow to pause a survey in order to resume and submit it in a second data entry session.
• Preserve history: Preserves saved response denying any modification to DEFINITELY submitted answers.
Until the response is "in progress" (whether used in conjunction with "Allow Pause/Resume" setting)
you will be allowed to continue its compilation. Once it is submitted as "closed" if you go to edit it again,
you will be forced to edit and save a copy of it in order to preserve the history of your original response.
• Anonymous responses: the responses management table does not show the owner of the responses and reports are anonymous.
• Minimum allowed year: the minimum year the module will take into account. This value can be further restricted at element level.
• Maximum allowed year: the maximum year the module will take into account. This value can be further restricted at element level.
• Custom style sheet: a personal cascade style sheet (css) for the current surveypro only
• Maximum allowed attempts: The maximum number of responses a student is allowed to submit for this activity.
• Notify role: The role whose members will receive a notification email at each user response.
The email will only advise about response from the user, not about its content and without sender details.
• More notifications: Some additional email addresses to notify about new responses. Addresses are supposed to be one per row.
• Thanks web page: The html code of the web page the user get at each response closing time.
• Deadline of risky modification session: Allow users permitted to manage survey elements to force modifications even for surveys already answered.

A list of "elements" are available to create the surveypro.
This list of "elements" is divided into: "fields" and "format" elements.
Fields and formats are pluggable so each developer can create a new kind of field, i.e. a new kind of question, to use it is his special surveypro.
In the starting release of surveypro was crafted with:
• 17 items of type "field"
• 3 items of type "format"

The 18 fields type are:
• element type "age" to ask for question like: "How old were you when you learned to ride a bike?"
• element type "autofill" to autofill a field with infos from user, course, time, date or surveypro
• element type "boolean" to ask for question like: "Is it true?"
• element type "character" to ask for question like: "Write down your email" or "Enter your personal web site URL" or "Enter the PIN code of your card"
• element type "checkbox" to ask for question like: "What do you usually get for breakfast?" A: "milk, sugar, jam, chocolate, other..."
• element type "date" to ask for question like: "When were you born?"
• element type "datetime" to ask for question like: "Please, write down date and time of your last flight to Los Angeles."
• element type "fileupload" to ask for question like: "Upload your CV in PDF format"
• element type "integer" to ask for question like: "How many people does your family have besides you?"
• element type "multiselect" to ask for question like: "What do you usually get for breakfast?" A: "milk, sugar, jam, chocolate"
• element type "numeric" to ask for question like: "Write the best approximation of π you can remember"
• element type "radiobutton" to ask for question like: "Where do you usually spend your summer holidays?" A: "sea, mountain, lake, hills, desert..."
• element type "rate" to ask for question like: "How confident are you with the following languages? EN, ES, IT, FR. Mother tongue, very confident, not enough, unknown."
• element type "recurrence" to ask for question like: "When do you usually celebrate your name-day? June, 7"
• element type "select" to ask for question like: "Where do you usually spend your summer holidays?" A: "sea, mountain, lake, hills, desert..."
• element type "shortdate" to ask for question like: "When did you buy your current car?" A: "September 2004"
• element type "textarea" to ask for question like: "Write a short description of yourself"
• element type "time" to ask for question like: "At what time do you usually get up in the morning in the working days?"" A: "7:00"

The 4 format type are:
• element type "fieldset" to group your question
• element type "fieldsetend" to close an opened fieldset
• element type "pagebreak"
• element type "label" to display labels in the surveypro page

Each element (== fields + formats) is hight configurable.
It has part of its settings shared with all the other fields and formats and,
on the opposite side, has a very special set of personal settings.

The common field settings are usually divided into three fieldset:
• General settings
• Availability
• Branching
The very special set of personal setting of each item is always enclosed in a specific fieldset named:
• <<element type>> specific settings
• Validation options

and they are:
• General settings->Content: the text content of the element as it will be shown to remote user.
• General settings->Required(*): a flag to make the element mandatory or optional
• General settings->Indent: the indent of the element alias the left margin the element will respect once drawn.
• General settings->Question position: the position of the content of the element.
It can be to the left of the user interface, in a dedicated row just upper the interface to enter the answer
or in a dedicated row just upper the interface spanning all the row.
Note: The left position forces element contents to plain text without images.
The two 'top' positions are usually needed for contents longer than few words and are required for questions containing images!
• General settings->Element number: the custom number of the element.
It may be a natural number such as 1 or 1.a or whatever you may choose.
Take in mind that you are responsible for coherence of that numbers.
Because of this take care if you plan to change the order of the elements.
• General settings->Hide filling instruction(*): elements are equipped with filling instructions explaining
what each user is supposed to enter in the field. This flag allow to hide this instructions.
• General settings->Variable: the name of the element once it is downloaded
• General settings->Additional note: use this option to add a personal comment to your item.
It help improving instructions to fill the element.
(*) few field may miss this setting because not applicable

• Availability->Hidden: to hide the element. Hided elements will not be available at all.
You can consider these elements as not part of the survey.
• Availability->Search form: <<TODO: add the the description>>
• Availability->Reserved element: <<TODO: add the the description>>

• Branching->Parent element: <<TODO: add the the description>>
• Branching->Parent content: <<TODO: add the the description>>

• <<element type>> specific settings->
• Validation options

Relevant not so common features:
    -> relational db creation
    -> possibility to use "values" different from "labels" for checkboxes, radiobutton, select, multiselect and rate
    -> conditional branching
    -> export format
    -> user templates to store and quickly paste sets of items
    -> very close input validation
    -> a lot of examples among tests/fixtures/usertemplate describing each possible use of each core elements

How to create a surveypro
1) limit the number of responses of the users
2) send to enrolled users a reminder email if they are late
3) send the user response by email to roles or specific email
4) save to database not the label of the checkbox or of the select but the corresponding value
5) get positional answer from checkbox answers at export time
6) allow the user to say "to this mandatory question, my answer is: `I don't answer`" that corresponds to what we say "I have the answer but I don't want to share it with you"
7) export the surveypro answers in different formats
8) verify if your surveypro has "well defined" relations
9) share your borning surveypro in XML with your partners by email
10) allow users to pause/resume a surverpro
11) drop abandoned responses
11) allow the users to change their response BUT forcing them to save the modified response to a new one in order to preserve the history of what they did?
12) add notes (filling instructions) for each item.
13) have mandatory or optional questions
14) define the format of short text items. email? url? even regulars expressions are allowed
15) define the name of the variable to get it in the exported file
16) define a custom question number (3 or 3.a or whatever you may like)
17) indent questions to let you better understand the general behaviour of the surveypro
18) hide items that are still in progress or that you still don't know if you want to have them into your surveypro or not
19) reorder items
20) duplicate an item to save time
21) search among submitted responses choosing the items to search for
22) create relational databases once your surveypro are exported
23) create parent child relations
24) limit the minimum and the maximum year at surveypro level in order to reduce typos at input time
25) limit the input range of each item at item level
26) have COLLES built using radio buttons OR select items
27) develop your own new type of question, format
28) use builtin reports (or develop the one you like more)
29) translate your super important surveypro in a mastertempalete and create a clone of your super important surveypro in few clicks
30) have a surveypro from your mastertemplate that is AT THE SAME TIME in English for you and in Italian for me? You see it in English and I see THE SAME URL in Italian. THE SAME URL means, the same database collecting our responses.
31) open a period of risk in which "what should not be allowed" is allowed. To explain it better: a surveypro is online. Users started to submit their responses. I found an error. I need to correct it but... take care: if you edit an already submitted surveypro you risk to make a mess. What happens to answers if you add or drop an item? What happen to answers if you change the number or the content of the options of a select? Well it is really dangerous BUT if you know what you are doing and you really need to make changes (I did it only once in 10 years) you can ask to surveypro a "risky modification period" in which you are allowed to do what, generally, you shouldn't do.
